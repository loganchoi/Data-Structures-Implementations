Programming assignment 4 (PA04)
===============================

# Array-based List (std::vector)
---

## What is this repository?
The files listed here are the starting point for your assignment.
Only add source files (not compiled files) to the Git repository.

## Note (actually do this)!!
Thoroughly read the Canvas page **How to: Homework Submissions** for good tips, tricks, hints, and instructions on programming assignments, including how to submit via Git.

## Assignment description
Mimic the std::vector behavior with your array-based list implementation (arraylist). When implementing your list, you must use a *dynamic array*. And
you are expected to use the **same names and declarations** as defined by the 
STL implementation of an array list, the vector. Don't forget that the vector
you implement must be templated on the data type it stores, too.

### Background reading and resources:
* Lecture notes 08a and 08b and the sample lecture codes
* General container library
  * http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container
* Vector
  * http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector (the more official source)
  * http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/vector/vector/ (may also help)
* Overloading operator syntax
  * https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/operators

## Input/Output
Given only indirectly this time. The sample input and output are defined in
terms of the behavior of the std::vector (which you must fully test yourself).

## Grading
100% of this assignment will be graded based on the successful implementation of the functions in the header file using unit testing.
Each function's performance on its own unit test will be worth a certain subset of those points, and the output of main will as well.

## Due date
Please see the schedule on the Canvas platform for all due dates.
